I like to learn new things, listen to music, play videogames, go to the movies and go out with my girlfriend or my friends to the movies, to eat or go to pool. When I finish engineering I would like to have learned more about programming, especially if it can be oriented towards video game development, and I would also like to have a good job abroad.",
